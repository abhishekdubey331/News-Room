# NewsMania
A sample app to demonstrate the building of a good, modular and scalable Android app using Kotlin, Android Architecture Components (LiveData, ViewModel), Dagger, RxJava and RxAndroid among others.

# Features
Some of the features of the app include

- **Effective Networking** - Using a combination of Retrofit, Rx and LiveData, we are able to handle networking efficiently.

- **Modular** - The app is broken into modules of features and libraries which can be combined to build instant-apps, complete apps or lite version of apps.

- **MVVM architecture** - Using the lifecycle aware ViewModels, the view observes changes in the model / repository.

- **Kotlin** - This app is completely written in Kotlin.

- **Android Architecture Components** - Lifecycle awareness has been achieved using a combination of LiveData, ViewModels.

 - **Offline Support** - App uses Retrofit for caching data to be shown when user is offline.

 - **Dependency Injection** - Common elements like `context`, `networking` interface are injected using Dagger 2.

 - **Feature based packaging** - This screen-wise / feature-wise packaging makes code really easy to read and debug.
